# Simple Banking System

This Python script demonstrates a simple banking system implemented using object-oriented programming principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Overview

## The project consists of three main modules:

- contas.py: Defines abstract classes for bank accounts (Conta) and specific types of accounts such as savings (ContaPoupanca) and current accounts (ContaCorrente). It includes methods for depositing and withdrawing money from accounts.
- pessoas.py: Defines classes for individuals (Pessoa) and clients (Cliente). A client can have a bank account associated with them.
- banco.py: Defines the Banco class, which represents a bank and provides methods for authenticating clients and managing accounts.

## Usage

- Run the banco.py script to create a bank instance.
- Instantiate clients and accounts using classes defined in pessoas.py and contas.py.
- Add clients and accounts to the bank instance.
- Authenticate clients and perform banking operations such as depositing and withdrawing money.
